<content type="html" xml:base="https://rushilsaha.github.io/week1.html"><p>Hello this will be a blog that discusses the interesting research topics that are both discussed and research at the SPQR group at the University of Michigan. The topics are mainly in embedded security and concerned with finding and covering up vulnerabilities in common devices like the Amazon Alexa and iPhone. I will be posting weekly on topics that I found exciting and that I think more people should be aware of especially since the embedded security topics pertain to devices that many people own.</p></content>
