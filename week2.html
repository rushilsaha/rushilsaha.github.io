    <h2 class="blogpost"> Week 2: </h2>
    <h2 class="date"> March 3, 2021 </h2>
    <h1 class="titlepost"> This week's post will cover an interesting attack that uses the lidar sensors in robot vacuum cleaners to eavesdrop on sensitive
    audio. This is one specific attack that lies under a more general class of attacks that are concerned with collecting some sort of personal information through vulnerabilities
    within smart devices. This side channel attack was able to collect information playing from someone's TV and computer, both of which can lead to serious security issues. This paper is titled
    "Spying with Your Robot Vacuum Cleaner: Eavesdropping via Lidar Sensors" and was written by several students at the National University of Singapore.
    <p><p> The system works based on the concept of sound waves from a particular object creating subtle vibrations in other objects that can be recorded by the lidar sensor and then
    uploaded to the cloud. There were two types of attacks employed, a speech based attack and sound based attack which were mainly used to record speech from a computer speaker and music from a TV.
    The attack was tested by measuring its accuracy in correctly recording digit and music recordings. It was able to achieve a very impressive accuracy of
    91% and 90% respectively. One of the main issues in completing this attack was the low signal to noise ratio which made it difficult to accurately record the reflected signals
    which contained the sensitive data. This problem was solved by applying a variety of different methods to the signal, ranging from interpolation to a high pass filter to noise removal.
    This made the signal easier to process. <p><p> This paper brings up interesting concerns about ordinary devices that appear perfectly safe in one's household. I for one was not aware that such small vulnerabilities in a device as
    innocuous as a robot vacuum cleaner could lead to such a serious invasion of privacy. This is certainly something that people should look into before purchasing similar devices because security breaches
    such as these are no joke.</h1>
